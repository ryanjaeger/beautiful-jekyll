At Penn State, I majored in Mathematics, and took a series of courses in discrete mathematics, linear programming, linear algebra, combinatorics, and stochastic modeling. Beyond my math coursework, I also took classes in data science, statistics, and technical writing to round out my education. Below is a selection of projects from my undergraduate coursework that best capture my computational, statistical, and communication abilities. 

Speech Emotion Recognition ([PDF](files/Color Histograms for SER.pdf))

For an applied data science course, my partner and I were tasked with developing a machine learning model to correctly classify the emotion behind speech clips from the Berlin Emotional Dataset. Here, we developed a novel method for detecting the emotion in a speech clip and compare our method to an ensembled classifier and a convolutional neural network. While our method did not have superior accuracy, it is more robust and scalable than the other models tested. This project awarded the Best Paper Award within the class for the novelty of our method and the clarity of our writing.
