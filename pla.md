Penn State's [Presidential Leadership Academy](https://academy.psu.edu/) is a three-year leadership experience meant to foster critical thinking and decision making in students through seminar classes, field trips, and weekly reflection. Each class of 30 is selected from over 200 applicants to create a cohort representing diverse backgrounds, majors, and experiences. Here is my final reflection on my time in the Academy and how it shaped my understanding of leadership. 

### Coursework

During sophomore year, Academy members take a seminar with the President Barron focused on major issues facing universities, such as free speech on campus, Greek life, and balancing the budget. Students also take a course with the Dean of the Schreyer Honors College focusing on deep-dive into one issue, culminating in a policy proposal. For my year, the focus of our course was college student mental health. My team's policy focused on implementing technology-based solutions to the increased demand on campus counseling resources, introducing the Triage Tool, the Red Folder Intiative, and Lean On Me. Since our policy's publication in 2016, the Red Folder has become a reality at Penn State, and every faculty and staff member is equipped with it to help students in crisis.
